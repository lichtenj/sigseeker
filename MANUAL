Installation

	Install each of the desired peak calling approaches based on their specific guidelines:

	Ensure that SigSeeker.pm is configured to work with your directory structure

Execution

	Store bed formatted aligned read files in the read directory specified in SigSeeker.pm

	Add "setup.tsv" to directory containing aligned reads
	
		File contains setup information for each of the aligned reads. The aligned reads need to be named in following pattern: <PROJECTNAME>_<ID>.bed

		Reads describing the same cell type are to be located on the same line of the file.

		All samples of the same cell type are comma separated on their line. The same goes for control files. Samples and controls are tab separated from each other.

		Each line contains the celltype name and the epigenetic mark/factor at the beginning.

		For example an experiment describing the profile of transcription factor GATA1 (EX_1.bed and EX_2.bed) in hematopoietic stem cells (as compared to a control profile EX_3.bed and EX_4.bed) using 2 replicates would be represented in the following fashion:

			HSC-GATA1	1,2	3,4

	Example of script execution

		perl peakcalling_pipeline.pl PROJECTNAME mm9 true true true true false false false false notification_email@bosc.org
