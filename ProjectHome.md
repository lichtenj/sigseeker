Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) enables the genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation (CH3; MethylSeq), transcription factor (TF) occupancy and histone modifications (ChIPSeq). Analysis tools for NGS data use different algorithms, leading to different results from the same data. Findings corroborated by multiple programs represent the highest confidence data and should be the standard in genomics. Currently there is no integrated framework that allows analysis by multiple approaches, reducing the utility of NGS data to the field of genomics.

To address this problem we developed SigSeeker, an ensemble that can be used to process existing as well as novel NGS data. SigSeeker maps sequencing reads, detects enriched regions within the mapped reads, and correlates these regions with RNA expression and other datasets. Input data are supplied to each analysis package and the results for the different packages are compiled into a single profile, which can be correlated with mRNA expression datasets. Statistical analyses of the report are also provided.

In summary, the novel SigSeeker ensemble demonstrates that epigenetic modifications change dramatically during hematopoiesis and identifies critical regions of the genome that regulate hematopoietic cell fate. Our ensemble technique exceeds the sensitivity of single approaches (up 300% better true positive detection) and is ideal for identifying high confidence epigenetic profiles.
